# Getting Started with Dobermann

Dobermann bridges the gap between table-structured data and JSON APIs — enabling fast, efficient API interactions at scale. Take your spreadsheet data, map it to an API template, and execute thousands of requests with validation, transformation, and real-time results.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 5 steps:

1. **Create an Environment** — Define your API base URL and authentication
2. **Create an Endpoint** — Configure HTTP method, URL, headers, and body template
3. **Test with Run API** — Execute a single request to verify your configuration
4. **Run a Batch** — Enter data in the grid or upload an Excel/CSV file, map columns to template variables, and execute
5. **Watch it Go** — The Console opens automatically with results streaming in real-time. Sit back and watch your batch execute — don't grab a coffee, you'll miss the show.

## Core Concepts

### Environments

Environments define where your APIs run (development, staging, production). Each environment includes a base URL, authentication method (JWT, OAuth, or Google Service Account), and optional configuration like timezone and parallel processing.

### Endpoints

Endpoints are complete API request configurations — HTTP method, URL path, query parameters, headers, and a request body template. Configure once, then run individually or in batches with thousands of rows. Share endpoints with your team in a single click.

### Template Variables

Template variables use `{{variableName}}` syntax to create dynamic requests. Variables work in URL paths, query parameters, headers, and request bodies. For batch execution, source data columns map to template variables.

### Transactions

Every API request (individual or batch) creates a transaction record with request details, response data, and execution metadata.

### Batch Execution

Batch execution processes multiple API requests from your data. Enter values directly into the data grid or upload an Excel/CSV file, map columns to template variables, configure options (parallel processing, error tolerance), and execute. Monitor progress in real-time.

## Your First Workflow

Follow this complete workflow to execute your first API request.

### Step 1: Create an Environment

1. Click the **+** icon next to "Environments" in the sidebar
2. Enter environment name (e.g., "Development")
3. Enter base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
4. Choose authentication method and configure credentials
5. Click **Save Environment**
6. Right-click environment and select **Set as Active**

### Step 2: Create an Endpoint

1. Click the **+** icon next to "Endpoints" in the sidebar
2. Enter endpoint name (e.g., "Create Order")
3. Select HTTP method (POST)
4. Enter URL path (e.g., `/api/orders`)
5. Add headers if needed (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`)
6. Define request body template with variables
7. Click **Save Endpoint**

**Example request body:**
```json
{
    "orderId": "{{orderId:number}}",
    "customerName": "{{customerName:string}}",
    "quantity": "{{quantity:number}}"
}
```

### Step 3: Run a Single API Call

1. Right-click your endpoint
2. Select **Run API**
3. Enter values for template variables:
   - orderId: `12345`
   - customerName: `John Doe`
   - quantity: `10`
4. Click **Execute**
5. Console opens showing request/response details

### Step 4: Run a Batch

1. Right-click your endpoint and select **Run Batch**
2. Enter data directly into the grid, or upload an Excel/CSV file
3. Map source data columns to template variables:
   - `orderId` → `ORDER_ID`
   - `customerName` → `CUSTOMER_NAME`
   - `quantity` → `QUANTITY`
4. Configure batch options (parallel processing, error tolerance)
5. Click **Run Batch**

### Step 5: Watch it Go

The Console opens automatically and results stream in real-time as each request completes. You'll see live progress, success/error counts, and response times — all updating as the batch runs.

## What's Next?

Now that you've completed your first workflow, explore these features:

**Template Variables:** Learn about data types, modifiers, auto-generated variables, and the template editor. See [Template Variables](template-variables).

**Batch Preparation:** Master data loading, column mapping, and data transformations. See [Batch Preparation](batch-preparation).

**Console:** Understand queue, parallel processing, error tolerance, and analyse results with the Console. See [Console](console).

**Environments:** Configure authentication (JWT, OAuth, Google Service Account), timezone, parallel threads, and more. See [Environments](environments).

**Sharing:** Copy endpoint configurations and paste them in Teams, Outlook, or Confluence. See [Endpoints](endpoints#sharing).

**Import/Export:** Share endpoint and environment configurations with your team. See [Import/Export](import-export).
