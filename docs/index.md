## What is Dobermann?

Excel is still the number one tool for working with data. But working with JSON APIs from a spreadsheet? Almost impossible. Dobermann bridges that gap — take your spreadsheet data, map it to an API template, and execute thousands of requests with validation, transformation, and real-time results.

- **Endpoint Configuration** — Define HTTP method, URL, headers, body templates, and share them with your team
- **Template Variables** — Map spreadsheet columns to API fields with type validation, modifiers, and conditional logic
- **Environment Management** — Manage connections, authentication, and per-environment variables
- **Batch Execution** — Process thousands of rows with parallel processing and live progress
- **Real-Time Reporting** — Watch results stream in as your batch executes
